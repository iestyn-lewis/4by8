## What is it?

The CZ Patch Library (CZPL) is a little black box with over 1200 patches for the Casio CZ series.  Brasses, basses, pads, leads, percussion, drums, it's all in there.  

## How do I connect it?

Plug the MIDI cable into your Casio CZ-101, CZ-1000, CZ-3000, CZ-5000, or CZ-230S synthesizer and power the CZPL via USB or a 9V power adapter.  

## How do I use it?

Enter the number of the patch you want to hear and press the A button.  The patch is instantly loaded into your Casio's Memory slot A1.  From here you can save the patch to any of your Casio's Memory locations.  Or, browse the library using the # and * keys.

## How can I see it in action?

Here is a video of a preproduction version.  Please note that the production version has over 1200 patches, not the 450 as stated in the video.
