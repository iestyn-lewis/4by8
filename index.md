## What is it?

The CZ Preset Library (CZPL) is a little black box with 1000 patches for the Casio CZ series.  Brasses, basses, pads, leads, percussion, drums, it's all in there.

## How do I connect it?

Plug the MIDI cable into your Casio CZ-101, CZ-1000, CZ-3000, CZ-5000, or CZ-230S synthesizer and power the CZPL via USB or a 9V power adapter (center positive).

## How do I use it?

Enter the number of the patch you want to hear and press the A button.  The patch is instantly loaded into your Casio's Memory slot A1.  From here you can save the patch to any of your Casio's Memory locations.  Or, browse the library using the # and * keys.
